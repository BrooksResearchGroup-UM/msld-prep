### A collection of python scripts and procedures to enable the building of ligands for Multi-site lambda Dynamics simulations using CHARMM/pyCHARMM

*msld-py-prep* scripts for creating a multiple topology model for Multisite 位-Dynamics (MS位D) in CHARMM and pyCHARMM. 

These scripts identify common atoms (similar partial atomic charge and identical atom types) across different compounds of interest with a maximum common substructure search. A charge renormalization algorithm is then implemented to generate a set of partial atomic charges suitable for multisite sampling of many chemical functional groups with MS位D. 

The output is a directory of CHARMM compatible files to use for MS位D simulations, including an example CHARMM input script.
